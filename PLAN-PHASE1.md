# SpringKeys Phase 1: Core Desktop Application Architecture

## Overview
This phase establishes the core architecture for the desktop application, implementing a clean separation between backend and frontend components. The goal is to create a working foundation that can be built upon in subsequent phases.

## Core Objectives
- [v] Implement basic desktop application structure
- [x] Create backend data structures and services
- [v] Develop terminal-based frontend
- [v] Establish communication layer
- [v] Implement basic typing input/output

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Backend Architecture
- [x] Design core data structures
  ```rust
  // Key data structures
  struct TypingSession {
      text: String,
      start_time: DateTime,
      end_time: Option<DateTime>,
      metrics: TypingMetrics,
  }

  struct TypingMetrics {
      wpm: f32,
      accuracy: f32,
      errors: Vec<TypingError>,
  }

  struct GameState {
      current_game: GameType,
      score: i32,
      level: i32,
      status: GameStatus,
  }
  ```
- [x] Implement state management system
- [x] Create service layer for business logic
- [x] Design event system for game mechanics
- [x] Implement configuration management

### 2. Frontend Architecture
- [v] Design terminal UI framework
  ```rust
  // Core UI components
  struct TerminalUI {
      dimensions: (u32, u32),
      buffer: Vec<Vec<Cell>>,
      cursor: Position,
  }

  struct Cell {
      character: char,
      style: Style,
      physics: Option<PhysicsState>,
  }
  ```
- [v] Implement basic rendering system
- [v] Create input handling system
- [x] Design UI component hierarchy
- [x] Implement basic animations

### 3. Communication Layer
- [v] Design message protocol
  ```rust
  enum Message {
      Input(InputEvent),
      StateUpdate(GameState),
      Render(RenderCommand),
      Error(ErrorType),
  }
  ```
- [v] Implement message passing system
- [x] Create event bus
- [x] Design state synchronization
- [x] Implement error handling

### 4. Core Features
- [v] Basic terminal rendering
- [v] Character input/output
- [x] Simple physics simulation
- [v] Basic game loop
- [x] Configuration loading

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- [v] Set up backend unit tests
- [v] Create frontend component tests
- [x] Implement integration tests
- [x] Set up performance benchmarks
- [x] Create test data generators

## Dependencies
- [v] Terminal manipulation library
- [v] Physics engine components
- [v] Event handling system
- [v] Configuration management
- [v] Logging framework

## Success Criteria
- [v] Backend can process typing input
- [v] Frontend can render basic UI
- [v] Components can communicate effectively
- [v] Basic typing test can be run
- [x] Configuration can be loaded/saved
- [v] All core tests pass

## Next Phase Preparation
- [x] Review physics engine requirements
- [x] Identify performance bottlenecks
- [x] Document API for game mechanics
- [x] Plan character animation system

## Notes
- Focus on clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Prioritize testability and maintainability
- Keep communication layer simple but extensible
- Document all public APIs thoroughly

## Risk Assessment
- [x] Terminal compatibility across platforms
- [x] Performance of rendering system
- [x] State management complexity
- [x] Error handling coverage

## Timeline
- Estimated duration: 2 weeks
- Critical path: Backend → Frontend → Communication → Testing
