## Recent Implementation: Comprehensive Typing Metrics System

We've implemented a robust typing metrics system that provides detailed analytics on typing performance:

### Key Features
- Detailed per-character typing statistics tracking
- Speed metrics for different keyboard rows (top, home, bottom)
- Speed metrics for individual fingers (all 8 fingers)
- Short-term and long-term running averages for all metrics
- Visual keyboard heatmap showing typing speed performance
- Color-coded performance bars for keyboard rows and fingers
- Real-time metrics header showing current performance

### Technical Implementation
- Created `src/core/metrics.rs` with comprehensive metrics tracking system
- Implemented detailed character-level statistics (speed, accuracy)
- Added category metrics for grouping analysis (rows, fingers, character types)
- Updated the core `TypingSession` to use our enhanced metrics
- Modified the `InputProcessor` to work with the new metrics system
- Added UI components to display the metrics data in real-time
- Created `src/ui/heatmap.rs` for keyboard visualization

This enhancement significantly improves the typing tutor by providing detailed feedback on typing performance, helping users identify their weak points and track improvements over time. The visual representations (heatmaps, performance bars) make it intuitive to see which keys and fingers need more practice.
