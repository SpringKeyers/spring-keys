# SpringKeys Phase 0: Project Initialization

## Overview
This phase establishes the foundational project structure and development environment. The goal is to have a working development environment with basic project structure and documentation.

## Core Objectives
- [v] Establish project repository and structure
- [v] Set up development environment
- [x] Create initial documentation
- [x] Define development workflow
- [x] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Repository Setup
- [v] Initialize Git repository
- [v] Create .gitignore for Rust project
- [x] Set up branch protection rules
- [x] Configure GitHub Actions for basic CI
- [x] Create development, staging, and main branches

### 2. Project Structure
- [v] Create basic Rust project structure
```springkeys/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── core/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── examples/
└── Cargo.toml
```
- [v] Set up workspace configuration
- [v] Create initial module structure
- [v] Configure Rust toolchain

### 3. Development Environment
- [v] Document required tools and versions
  - Rust toolchain
  - Cursor IDE
  - Terminal requirements
  - OS-specific dependencies
- [v] Create development environment setup script
- [x] Document environment variables
- [x] Set up debugging configuration

### 4. Documentation
- [v] Create comprehensive README.md
- [x] Document project architecture
- [x] Create contribution guidelines
- [x] Set up documentation generation
- [x] Create initial API documentation structure

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Configure automated testing
- [x] Set up code coverage reporting
- [x] Configure automated documentation generation
- [x] Set up automated dependency updates

### 6. Development Workflow
- [x] Define branching strategy
- [x] Create PR template
- [x] Set up issue templates
- [x] Define commit message format
- [x] Create release process documentation

## Testing Strategy
- [v] Set up unit testing framework
- [v] Configure integration testing
- [x] Set up code coverage tools
- [x] Create initial test documentation

## Dependencies
- [v] Define core dependencies
- [v] Document version requirements
- [v] Set up dependency management
- [v] Configure dependency updates

## Success Criteria
- [v] Repository is properly structured
- [v] Development environment is documented and reproducible
- [x] CI/CD pipeline is operational
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive
- [x] Development workflow is defined
- [v] All team members can build and run the project

## Next Phase Preparation
- [x] Review Phase 1 requirements
- [x] Identify potential blockers
- [x] Prepare development environment for Phase 1
- [x] Schedule Phase 1 kickoff

## Notes
- This phase focuses on infrastructure and setup
- No actual application code is written yet
- Emphasis on documentation and reproducibility
- All tools and processes should be automated where possible

## Risk Assessment
- [x] Identify potential environment setup issues
- [x] Document OS-specific considerations
- [x] Plan for dependency conflicts
- [x] Consider security implications

## Timeline
- Estimated duration: 1 week
- Critical path: Repository setup → Environment setup → Documentation → CI/CD

## Review Checklist
- [x] All tasks completed and checked
- [x] Documentation reviewed
- [x] Environment tested by multiple team members
- [x] CI/CD pipeline verified
- [x] Security review completed
- [x] Performance baseline established
